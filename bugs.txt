I found the below bug while doing the automation

1. I can see Thick Crust instead of thin crust

Steps:
1. Send message 'I want to order pizza'
2. select veg/non-veg pizza
3. select any topping, i selected cheese
4. you can see Great! you have selected cheese

Observed: Able to see Thin crust heading but Thick crust link

Expected: link text should also be Thin crust
